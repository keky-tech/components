## Development

### Start by cloning the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:keky-tech/picasso.git
```

### Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Run a workspace

You can use the `pnpm --filter=[WORKSPACE]` command to start the development process for a workspace.

#### Examples

1. To run the `picasso` example website:

```
pnpm --filter=www dev
```

2. To run the `picasso` package:

```
pnpm --filter=picasso dev
```

## Documentation

The documentation for this project will be locate in the `www` workspace. You will run the documentation locally by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter=www dev
```

Documentation will be write using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). You will find the documentation files in the `apps/www/content/docs` directory.

## Components

We use a registry system for developing components. You can find the source code for the components under `apps/www/registry`. The components are organized by styles.

```bash
apps
└── www
    └── registry
        ├── example
        └── ui
```

When adding or modifying components, please ensure that:

1. You make the changes for every style.
2. You update the documentation.
3. You run `pnpm build:registry` to update the registry.
